      'The idea for this tracker sparked from a common question among friends and community members: "Where is the chariot now?" We often found ourselves just as curious and uncertain about its current location during the Thaipusam procession. This recurring question inspired us to create a solution â€“ a live tracker to provide real-time updates and location information.',

We do not profit from this endeavor; rather, we invest our own resources to keep it running. Our aim is to ensure everyone has the opportunity to connect with and enjoy the festival, creating a sense of unity and shared experience.",
